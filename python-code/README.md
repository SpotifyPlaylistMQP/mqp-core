1. build_playlist-track_matrix.py
  - Gets each playlist's track list and builds it into a matrix `p` by `t`, where `p` is playlist and `t` is track
    - Each cell in the matrix contains a 1 if track `t` is in playlist `p`, and a 0 if not
  - The playlists can be specified by editing the `playlist_ids` list in build_playlist-track_matrix.py
