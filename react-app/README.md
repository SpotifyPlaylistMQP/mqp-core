# Spotify Playlist Continuation MQP

### Getting config files
The directory config/ should contain 1 file: spotify-config.json.
It is not in GitHub because it contains secret information, so ask Quinn for it.
You should only need to save it locally once, then it will stay on your machine, and (hopefully) not commit to github

### How to run
1. Run 'npm install' in root directory
2. Run 'npm start' in root directory
3. Open a new terminal, and run 'node server/routes.js'
